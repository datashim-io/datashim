# Serving Models stored in S3 buckets using Datashim Datasets

(_Note:_ Credit to
[YAML file from @zioproto](https://github.com/zioproto/kube-cheshire-cat/blob/1ae8be76e333482a2656431c9e6de59f2132c79c/kubernetes/tgi.yaml)
for TGI deployment in Kubernetes which provided the basis for the TGI deployment
shown in this example)

Large language models are the most interesting cloud workloads of the day. This
example demonstrates reducing the friction of loading models from an S3 bucket
using Datashim. For this example, we use the open-source
[Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) as the inference service that loads
the models and makes it available for prompt inputs.

> [!NOTE]  
> In this tutorial we will assume you are in the `datashim-demo` namespace. To
> create this namespace and set it as your current context you can run:
>
> ```commandline
> kubectl create namespace datashim-demo
> kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=datashim-demo
> ```

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites needed to follow this tutorial, as it will provide
instructions to provision a local S3 endpoint and store a model in it. If you
already have them, feel free to skip the optional instructions, but make sure to
update the values in the YAMLs, as they will all reference the setup we provide.

## (OPTIONAL) Creating a local object storage endpoint

The YAML we provide provisions a local MinIO instance using hardcoded
credentials.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not use this for any real production workloads!**

From this folder, simply run:

```commandline
kubectl create namespace minio
kubectl apply -f minio.yaml
kubectl wait pod --for=condition=Ready -n minio --timeout=-1s minio 
```

## Creating a Dataset

To access our data, we must first create a `Secret` containing the credentials
to access the bucket that holds our data, and then a `Dataset` object that links
configuration information to the access credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Make sure your active namespace is labelled with
> `monitor-pods-datasets=enabled` so that Datashim can mount volumes in the pods
> during the tutorial. Using `datashim-demo` as the namespace, run:
>
> ```commandline
> kubectl label namespace datashim-demo monitor-pods-datasets=enabled
> ```

Run

```commandline
kubectl apply -f minio-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f minio-dataset.yaml
```

It will apply the following:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: model-weights-secret
stringData:
  accessKeyID: "ACCESS_KEY"
  secretAccessKey: "SECRET_KEY"
---
apiVersion: datashim.io/v1alpha1
kind: Dataset
metadata:
  name: model-weights
spec:
  local:
    provision: "true"
    bucket: my-model
    endpoint: http://minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000
    secret-name: model-weights-secret
    type: COS
```

## (OPTIONAL) Adding a model in the object storage

In this tutorial we will use the
[FLAN-T5-Base model](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) as our set of
weights to be loaded. To load them in our MinIO instance we can run:

```
kubectl apply -f download-flan-t5-base-to-minio.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/download-flan --timeout=-1s
```

To create a download `Job` and wait for its completion:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: download-flan
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        dataset.0.id: "model-weights"
        dataset.0.useas: "mount"
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: alpine/git
          command: ["sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - cd /tmp && git clone https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base/
              && cp -r flan-t5-base /mnt/datasets/model-weights/flan-t5-base/
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: git
      restartPolicy: Never
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Using git to clone directly in `/mnt/datasets/model-weights/flan-t5-base/`
> would fail on OpenShift due to the default security policies.
> Errors such as `cp: can't preserve permissions` you might see in the pod
> logs can be safely ignored.

## Creating the TGI pod

As anticipated, we will use TGI to serve the model. Run

```
kubectl apply -f tgi+service.yaml
```

To create the following `Pod` and `Service`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: text-generation-inference
  labels:
    run: text-generation-inference
    dataset.0.id: "model-weights"
    dataset.0.useas: "mount"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: text-generation-inference
      image: ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.3.4
      env:
        - name: RUST_BACKTRACE
          value: "1"
      command:
        - "text-generation-launcher"
        - "--model-id"
        - "/mnt/datasets/model-weights/flan-t5-base/"
        - "--sharded"
        - "false"
        - "--port"
        - "8080"
        - "--huggingface-hub-cache"
        - "/tmp"
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: http
      readinessProbe:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
  restartPolicy: Never
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: text-generation-inference
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    run: text-generation-inference
  type: ClusterIP
```

The key lines are the labels starting with `dataset.0.` which define the
`model-weights` Dataset as an input to the TGI pod and the command arguments
`"--model-id"` which indicates to TGI to load the model weights
from a specific directory. In this example, the directory location points to the
volume where the bucket will eventually be mounted
(`/mnt/datasets/model-weights`) and where the model weights will be found.

We can wait for TGI to be ready using the command:

```commandline
kubectl wait pod --for=condition=Ready text-generation-inference --timeout=-1s
```

We can also monitor the pods by looking at the logs:

```commandline
kubectl logs -f text-generation-inference
```

If all goes well, you will see the following:

```txt
...

```

This indicates that the service has been set up successfully and is ready to
reply to prompts.

## Validating the deployment

We can now forward the service exposing TGI as such:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --address localhost pod/text-generation-inference 8888:8080
```

And run an inference request against it with:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8888/generate -X POST -d '{"inputs":"The square root of x is the cube root of y. What is y to the power of 2, if x = 4?", "parameters":{"max_new_tokens":1000}}'  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -r .generated_text
```

We should see the following output:

```
x = 4 * 2 = 8 x = 16 y = 16 to the power of 2
```
