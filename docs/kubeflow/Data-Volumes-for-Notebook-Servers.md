We will show how you can use DLF to provision Data Volumes for your notebook servers. This would be helpful in the cases your training data are stored in S3 Buckets.

## Requirements

You have access to the kubeflow dashboard and you have DLF installed.

Make sure you first follow the guide for [Installation](https://github.com/IBM/dataset-lifecycle-framework/wiki/Installation)

## Create a Dataset for the S3 Bucket

In this guide, we assume that your data are already stored in a remote s3 bucket.
Let's assume that you will launch your notebook server on the namespace `{my-namespace}`

``` yaml
apiVersion: datashim.io/v1alpha1
kind: Dataset
metadata:
  name: your-dataset
spec:
  local:
    type: "COS"
    accessKeyID: "access_key_id"
    secretAccessKey: "secret_access_key"
    endpoint: "https://YOUR_ENDPOINT"
    bucket: "YOUR_BUCKET"
    region: "" #it can be empty
```
Now just execute:
``` bash
kubectl create -f my-dataset.yaml -n {my-namespace}
```

## Provision Notebook with the Data Volume

Now use the Kubeflow Central Dashboard to follow the rest of the guide.
Choose the "Notebook Servers" item:

![Notebook Servers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/dataset-lifecycle-framework/master/doc/pictures/kubeflow1.png)

Select "New server":

![New server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/dataset-lifecycle-framework/master/doc/pictures/kubeflow2.png)

Head over to the "Data Volumes" section and fill out the form as follows:

![Data Volumes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/dataset-lifecycle-framework/master/doc/pictures/kubeflow3.png)

Now you can press "Launch" to start the notebook server.

After you connect, you can list the contents of `/mnt/dataset` and verity that the reflect the contents for your remote S3 bucket.
**NOTE**: all the changes that you do in this directory (delete,create,modify) will be reflected on the remote bucket
